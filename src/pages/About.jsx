        [Verse 1]
        <br />
        Iâ€™m tearing up
        <br />
        Across your face
        <br />
        Move dust through the light
        <br />
        To fide your name
        <br />
        It's something fane
        <br />
        This is not a place
        <br />
        Not yet awake
        <br />
        I'm raised of make
        <br />

        [Chorus]
        <br />
        Still alive, who you love
        <br />
        Still alive, who you love
        <br />
        Still alive, who you love
        <br />

        [Verse 2]
        <br />
        In a mother, out a moth
        <br />
        Furling forests for the soft
        <br />
        Gotta know been lead aloft
        <br />
        So I'm ridding all your stories
        <br />
        What I know, what it is, it's pouring; wire it up
        <br />
        You're breaking your ground
        </Typography>
      </Paper>
    </div>
